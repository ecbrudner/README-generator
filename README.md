# README-generator

## Description
I created this app to easily generate README files, which are a professional necessity for any project repository. By using the app, the user can avoid drafting an entire README file and simply enter their responses into the command line instead. In creating this project, I learned how to create a command-line application and use the inquirer package.

## Installation
User will need to install Node.js in order to use the application. [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) are instructions for installing Node.

## Usage
First, the user will launch the app by typing node index.js in their command line. From there, the user will answer each prompt with the information to populate their README file. Finally, the user will be presented with a fully generated README markdown file for their use.
